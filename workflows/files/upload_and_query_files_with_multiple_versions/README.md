# Upload and Query Files with Multiple Versions

This example workflow demonstrates how RDM is used to implement object versioning. Versioning applies broadly within RDM and can be used to modify objects of various types including:

- Files.
- Regions.
- Design Sets.
- Tasks.

This code demonstrates how a revision to an existing file at a Sitelink3D v2 site can be uploaded in contrast to simply uploading the revision as a new file of the same name. A typical application of this workflow is the uploading of design file revisions.
